%description
kcat is a generic non-JVM producer and consumer for Apache Kafka >= 0.8,
think of it as a netcat for Kafka.

In producer mode kcat reads messages from stdin, delimited with a
configurable delimiter (-D, defaults to newline), and produces them to the
provided Kafka cluster (-b), topic (-t) and partition (-p).

In consumer mode kcat reads messages from a topic and partition and prints
them to stdout using the configured message delimiter.

kcat also features a Metadata list (-L) mode to display the current state
of the Kafka cluster and its topics and partitions.

kcat is fast and lightweight; statically linked it is no more than 150Kb.

kcat was formerly known as kafkacat.
